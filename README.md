# Parkinson-s-Disease-Diagnosis-and-Prognosis

This repository hosts code and resources for the project "Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis and Prognosis." The goal of this project is to apply classical and quantum algorithms to classify and predict the progression of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in patients. This project aims to aid early detection, enhance treatment plans, and improve overall patient outcomes.

Project Overview
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Accurate diagnosis and prognosis are essential for timely intervention and effective management of the disease. In this project, we evaluate and compare classical machine learning techniques with quantum machine learning approaches to explore potential improvements in diagnosis and prognosis accuracy.

Methodology
This project utilizes a combination of classical machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) and quantum algorithms (e.g., Quantum SVM) for diagnosis and prognosis. The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, normalization, and feature engineering.
Model Training: Training classical models and quantum models on the prepared dataset.
Evaluation: Comparing the performance of classical vs. quantum models.
Optimization: Fine-tuning models for enhanced prediction accuracy.
Results
The comparative analysis revealed key insights into the effectiveness of classical versus quantum algorithms in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability. See the Results directory for detailed findings, including plots and evaluation metrics.
