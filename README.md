# Parkinson-s-Disease-Diagnosis-and-Prognosis

This repository hosts code and resources for the project "Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis and Prognosis." The goal of this project is to apply classical and quantum algorithms to classify and predict the progression of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in patients. This project aims to aid early detection, enhance treatment plans, and improve overall patient outcomes.

# Project Overview
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Accurate diagnosis and prognosis are essential for timely intervention and effective management of the disease. In this project, we evaluate and compare classical machine learning techniques with quantum machine learning approaches to explore potential improvements in diagnosis and prognosis accuracy.

# Methodology
This project utilizes a combination of classical machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) and quantum algorithms (e.g., Quantum SVM) for diagnosis and prognosis.

# Evaluation and Results
This project evaluated the performance and accuracy of RF, ANN and QSVM. For classification, this 
study evaluated support, F-1 score, recall and precision, based on the confusion matrices found after execution of 
the models.

 For Progression prediction of PD, this study evaluated mean squared error and r squared score of RF, ANN 
and QSVM.
